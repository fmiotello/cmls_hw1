# Spoken digits classifier

This is a simple speech classifier. It was developed as a project for the Computer Music: Languages and Systems course in [Politecnico of Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) (MSc in Music and Acoustic Engineering).

The classifier is able to recognize spoken digits (numbers from 0-9) and transcribe them into a corresponding class, having a dataset with audio recordings available. The [Free Spoken Digit Dataset](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset) is used for this task.
